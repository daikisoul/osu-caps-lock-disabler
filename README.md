## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

**osu-caps-lock-disabler** is a script specifically crafted to prevent the annoyance of the Caps Lock indicator light appearing when accidentally enabling Caps Lock during gameplay in rhythm games such as osu! and Quaver.

### Key Features:

- **Automatic Detection**: The script detects when `osu!.exe` or `quaver.exe` is running.
- **Caps Lock Disabling**: Caps Lock functionality is disabled while the game is active.
- **Game Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with both osu! and Quaver.
- **Automatic Execution**: Once placed in the Windows Startup folder, the script runs automatically with each system boot.

### Light Indicator Prevention:

By disabling the Caps Lock functionality while playing rhythm games, **osu-caps-lock-disabler** effectively prevents the annoying Caps Lock indicator light from appearing when accidentally toggling Caps Lock during gameplay.

- **Inability to Use Caps Lock in-game**: While the script is active, Caps Lock functionality is disabled within the game to prevent interference with gameplay.
